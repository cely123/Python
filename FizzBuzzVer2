"""Loop and Selection Coding Challenge 
1. Asks the user for two numbers (lower and upper). These two numbers will 
create a 
range for our project. 
2. The first number will be the lower limit of the range while the second 
number will 
be the upper limit of the range. 
3. Loop through the range of numbers (omitting zero if chosen as lower limit) 
and do 
the following: 
• If the number is evenly divisible by 30, print “Foo” 
• If the number is evenly divisible by 5, print “Bar” 
• If the number is evenly divisible by 3, print “Fizz” 
• If the number is evenly divisible by 2, print “Buzz” 
• If the number is evenly divisible by 3 and 2, print “FizzBuzz” 
• If the number does not meet any of the criteria above, print “Bazz” 
4. Finally print the following statements: 
• “The total numbers evaluated was _________.” 
• “There were ________ numbers that are divisible by 30.” 
• “There were ________ numbers that are divisible by 5.” 
• “There were ________ numbers that are divisible by 3.” 
• “There were ________ numbers that are divisible by 2.” 
• “There were ________ numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 2.” 
• “There were ________ numbers that didn’t meet any of the requirements 
above.”"""
