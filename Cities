"""Make a dictionary called cities.  Use the names of three cities as keys in your dictionary.  Create a dictionary of
information about each city and include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact about
that city.  The key of each city's dictionary should be something like country, population, and fact.  Loop through the
dictionary, printing only the name of each city.  Write a second loop that prints all of the information you have stored
about each city.  Finally, write a third loop that prints out all of the information in the dictionary."""
